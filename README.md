# AtlasBridge
Fixing grade files from various services, so they can be uploaded directly into ATLAS

---

This was inspired by another one of my projects (TeamsAtlasBridge), but to be designed from the ground up to be more generalized.
There will also (hopefully) be an option to send emails to students regarding missing work.

## Grade Sources
The different sources of student grades:
- [ ] Teams
    - [ ] Single assignment (already in TeamsAtlasBridge)
    - [ ] All assignments
- [ ] Big Ideas Online (math curriculum)
    - [ ] Raw Scores
    - [ ] Percentages
- [ ] Illuminate (low priority, may not have it after 2020-21)
    - [ ] Student Responses
    - [ ] "Data" (another output version)
- [ ] ~~Edcite~~ ‚Üê Not likely due to only exporting "First Name, Last Initial"
- [ ] Nearpod
    - [ ] Session report
    - [ ] Student report
- [ ] Peardeck
    - [ ] Google Slides
    - [ ] PowerPoint (if they ever implement those reports...)
